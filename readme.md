Skio or Scikit-io was a 2015 experimental project to create a common Python data
class to easily read, write and convert as many scientific (often proprietary)
data formats as possible.

The project was stopped during its development due to lack of time. This is the
latest version of the code database that comes directly from my personal
archives.

The project is no longer being maintained.
